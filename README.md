## Overview
The Rail Track Inspection System is an innovative solution designed to enhance railway safety and maintenance. This system collects ultrasonic data from railway tracks while moving at high speeds (15 km/hr to 120 km/hr). The collected data is analyzed using a machine learning model to predict potential faults in the railway track before they occur.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Collection:** Ultrasonic sensors gather precise track data at varying speeds.
- **AI-Based Fault Prediction:** An ML model analyzes data to detect patterns and forecast upcoming issues.
- **Location-Based Alerts:** The system provides the exact location of potential faults.
- **User-Friendly Mobile App:** A dedicated Android application (built with Kotlin) allows railway personnel to access fault predictions and diagnostics.
- **Preventive Maintenance:** Helps authorities take proactive measures, minimizing disruptions and accidents.

## How It Works
1. The system is mounted on a railway vehicle and collects ultrasonic data from the tracks.
2. The collected data is transmitted for real-time analysis.
3. The machine learning model processes the data and identifies potential faults.
4. The Android app displays alerts with the exact fault location, expected time of occurrence, and a suggested diagnosis.
5. Railway maintenance teams can take action based on predictive insights.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Safety:** Early fault detection reduces the risk of derailments and accidents.
- **Efficient Maintenance Planning:** Helps railway authorities schedule repairs proactively.
- **Cost Savings:** Reduces maintenance costs by addressing issues before they become critical.
- **Automation & Accuracy:** Eliminates manual inspections and provides more accurate results.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with cloud storage for historical data analysis.
- Expansion to support additional sensor types for comprehensive monitoring.
- Advanced AI models for improved prediction accuracy.

This project aims to revolutionize railway maintenance by leveraging advanced technology for safer and more efficient track monitoring.
